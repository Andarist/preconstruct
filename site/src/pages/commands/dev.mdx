# `dev`

`preconstruct dev` creates files and symlinks in the dist folders of entrypoints which map to the appropriate source file so that the package can be imported from Node and in bundlers and the source file will be imported.

## How should I use it?

It's best to use the `dev` command in a postinstall hook so that people don't have to worry about running it.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "preconstruct dev"
  }
}
```

> Note: `preconstruct dev` also needs to be run whenever the project's packages or entrypoints change.
