# Packages

Packages map 1:1 with npm packages. Along with specifying the `entrypoints` option described below, packages are also responsible for specifying dependencies which is necessary for bundling UMD bundles and ensuring that packages will have all of their required dependencies when installed through npm.

## `entrypoints`

`Array<string>`

`entrypoints` is an array of globs which specify the entrypoints which consumers of your package should be able to import.

### Default

> Note: this is the default value, if it's what you want, you don't need to specify it.

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "entrypoints": ["."]
  }
}
```

### Example

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "entrypoints": [".", "other-entrypoint"]
  }
}
```
