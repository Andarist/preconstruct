# Projects

Projects map 1:1 with a version control repository. They specify global configuration that applies to all builds.

## `packages`

`Array<string>`

`packages` is an array of globs which specify which packages should be built with preconstruct.

### Default

> Note: this is the default value, if it's what you want, you don't need to specify it.

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "packages": ["."]
  }
}
```

### Example

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "packages": ["packages/*"]
  }
}
```

## `globals`

`{ [packageName: string]: (umdName: string) }`

`globals` specifies the UMD names of `peerDependencies` since `peerDependencies` aren't bundled in UMD builds. You **shouldn't** specify this option manually, preconstruct will prompt you for the UMD name of a package when it's necessary.

### Default

> Note: this is the default value, if it's what you want, you don't need to specify it.

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "globals": {}
  }
}
```

### Example

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "globals": {
      "react": "React",
      "react-dom": "ReactDOM"
    }
  }
}
```
