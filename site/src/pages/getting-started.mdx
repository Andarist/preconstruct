# Getting Started

> **Note:** If you're new to building packages, you should go through [preconstruct's tutorials](/tutorials)

preconstruct is a build tool that aims to simplify a lot of the complexity in building packages.

Assuming you've already got a package and your source file is at `src/index.js`(or `src/index.ts` if you're using TypeScript), you can install preconstruct and run `preconstruct init` to setup preconstruct.

```bash
yarn add --dev preconstruct
yarn preconstruct init
```

preconstruct will ask some questions about your project and then update your package.json.

You'll now be able to build your project with `yarn preconstruct build`.

this needs more things but what exactly?
