# Getting Started

Before we can use preconstruct, we need a package to build. We're going to build a package that export a random number.

The first thing we're going to do is create a directory and run `yarn init` in it which will create a package.json for us.

```bash
$ yarn init
yarn init v1.15.2
question name (a-random-number):
question version (1.0.0):
question description:
question entry point (index.js):
question repository url:
question author:
question license (MIT):
question private:
success Saved package.json
```

Now we're going to create our source file. By default, preconstruct looks at the src directory to find the source file so we're going to create a file at `src/index.js` that looks like this.

```jsx
export let random = Math.random();
```

Now we can install preconstruct

```bash
yarn add --dev preconstruct
```

We can initialise preconstruct with `preconstruct init`.

```bash
yarn preconstruct init
```

## What have we got now?
