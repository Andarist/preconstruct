# When should I use multiple entrypoints?

Having multiple entrypoints in a package means that someone can import from different paths in the same package, e.g. `react-dom` and `react-dom/server`.

There are a couple reasons you may want to have multiple entrypoints in a package.

My thoughts from react-select discussion:

Also, having seperate browser and node things a la `react-dom` and `react-dom/server`
