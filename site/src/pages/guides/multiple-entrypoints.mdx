# Multiple Entrypoints

> **Note:** this guide builds upon knowledge in [the Getting Started guide](/getting-started) so if you haven't gone through it, you should do that first.

We're going to add another entrypoint to our `a-random-number` package called `create` so that people can import `a-random-number/create` to create their own random numbers.

The first thing we're going to do is create our entrypoint directory

```json
"preconstruct": {
  "entrypoints": [".", "create"]
}
```

```jsx
export let createRandomNumber = () => Math.random();
```
