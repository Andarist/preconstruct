# Monorepos

> **Note:** this guide builds upon knowledge in [the Getting Started guide](/getting-started) so if you haven't gone through it, you should do that first.

We're going to setup a monorepo that uses preconstruct to build its packages. We're also going to use [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) for linking and [Changesets](https://github.com/Noviny/changesets) for versioning, these tools aren't required to use preconstruct in a monorepo but they work really well together with preconstruct.

We have our `a-random-number` package from the [the Getting Started guide](/getting-started) which is awesome but we want to add another package, `the-number-one` so people can get the number one. We're going to use a monorepo to manage it because we want to be able to manage all our packages together.

## Setting up Yarn Workspaces

## Setting up preconstruct to build all our packages

## Setting up Changesets to version our packages
